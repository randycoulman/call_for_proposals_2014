# Affordances in Programming Languages

A good design communicates the intended use of an object. In the
physical world, this communication is accomplished by "affordances", as
discussed by Donald Norman in "The Psychology of Everyday Things".

Programming languages also have affordances, and they influence the
kinds of solutions we develop.  The more languages we know, the more
we "expand our design space" so that we can come up with better
solutions to the problems we face every day.

This talk will:

* Show example problems and their solutions in different languages

* Illustrate how the affordances provided by the languages influence
  the design.

* Discuss how to use this knowledge to make us better programmers

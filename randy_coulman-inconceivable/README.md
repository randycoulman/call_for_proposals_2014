# Inconceivable!

Ideas are everywhere.

Some ideas are similar to those we already have, so we adopt them
as tweaks or hacks that make our lives a little bit better.

Other ideas are more of a stretch, but if they seem genuinely helpful,
we'll adopt them after a little more consideration.

Then there are the ideas that are so crazy that it would be
absolutely, totally, and in all other ways inconceivable that they
could ever work.  We almost always reject these ideas out-of-hand.

Why do we reject the inconceivable ideas?  Should we? What happens if
we don't?

Let's look at some examples of previously-inconceivable ideas that
have changed the software development world forever.

Let's explore how we filter information and choose what to accept and
what to reject.

Let's look at how ideas change us so much that the world around us is
now completely different.

And let's look at some new inconceivable ideas that are so crazy that
they just might work.
